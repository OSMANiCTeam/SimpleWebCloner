Simple wget CLI website cloner for Linux, macOS compatible version coming soon
<br>
# Probably going to be asked questions
<h3>Why?</h3>
I always found it annoying having to manually type the wget link in, and I don't like using proprietary downloaders like IDM and FDM.
<h3>But your browser has a built in download manager</h3>
It's slow, that's why download managers like IDM and FDM as well as this script exists.
<h3>The script won't open on Windows</h3>
You clearly can't read, the description of this repo and top of the readme says: Simple wget CLI website cloner for <b>macOS and Linux</b>
<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
Here is the tutorial video: https://youtu.be/s8KjCtq_7hY
<h3>I get lots of errors when using macOS</h3>
Please make sure you are using the macOS version, which can be downloaded from the releases tab under release 1.3.1 and higher, then make sure wget is installed via <b>homebrew package manager</b>
<h3>How do I identify what version I am using?</h3>
Open the file in a text editor and look at the top few lines

# Requirements
-bash

-wget (Will auto-install via apt on Linux, please manually install via homebrew (https://brew.sh) if using macOS)

-echo
