Simple wget CLI website cloner for macOS and Linux
<br>
# Probably going to be asked questions
<h3>Why?</h3>
I always found it annoying having to manually type the wget link in, and I don't like using proprietary downloaders like IDM and FDM.
<h3>But your browser has a built in download manager</h3>
It's slow, that's why download managers like IDM and FDM as well as this script exists.
<h3>The script won't open on Windows</h3>
You clearly can't read, the description of this repo and top of the readme says: Simple wget CLI website cloner for <b>macOS and Linux</b>

# Requirements
-bash

-wget (If you don't have it, the script will install it for you using <b>apt</b>)

-echo
