Simple wget CLI website cloner for macOS and Linux
<br>
# Probably going to be asked questions
<h3>Why?</h3>
I always found it annoying having to manually type the wget link in, and I don't like using proprietary downloaders like IDM and FDM.
<h3>But your browser has a built in download manager</h3>
It cannot download an entire webpage with all scripts and stylesheets included.
<h3>HTTrack</h3>
Bruh that hasn't been updated since 2017, has no HTML5 or Modern Javascript support, and HTTPS is broken.
<h3>The script won't open on Windows</h3>
You clearly can't read, the description of this repo and top of the readme says: Simple wget CLI website cloner for <b>macOS and Linux</b>
<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
Linux: https://youtu.be/s8KjCtq_7hY

macOS: https://youtu.be/iiMrXx8I5ps
<h3>I get lots of errors when using macOS</h3>
Please make sure you are using the macOS version, which can be downloaded from the releases tab under release 1.3.1 and higher, then make sure wget is installed via <b>homebrew package manager</b>
<h3>How do I identify what version I am using?</h3>
Open the file in a text editor and look at the top few lines
<h3>I'm on macOS, why isn't the PATH configurator working?</h3>
The PATH Configurator does not currently work on macOS. I am working on a macOS Compatible version.
<h3>I'm on Linux, why isn't the PATH configurator working?</h3>
Make sure you have the latest version of the script, that the PATH configurator is in the same directory as the script, and that you give the script sudo permissions when prompted.

# Requirements
-bash

-wget (Will auto-install via apt on Linux, please manually install via homebrew (https://brew.sh) if using macOS)
